# Docker - Jenkins Integration with Spring Boot

In this project, I have implemented Spring Boot application, and integrated to dockerize that using Jenkins CI/CD.
Using Github repo link, we configure the jenkins to automate the CI/CD piepline. Then, we build docker image step configuration inthe jenkins project.
